Under GDPR, it is necessary to have a Data Privacy Impact Assessment related to where data are stored. This is typically done by the data protection officer and/or IT people. For more information on DPIA see https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/privacy-impact-assessment/.

Basic information related to store Brain Imaging data relates to answer:
- Which parties are involved?
- Which data types are sensitive?
- Which security measures (Privacy by Design, Privacy by Default and Privacy Enhancing Technologies) are applied?

Typically, DPIA also asks
- What is the goal of the data processing?
- What is the selected lawful basis for processing the data?

This is part of your job as researchers, i.e. the goal of the data processing is to answer research question as part of your public task.
