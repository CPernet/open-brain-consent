Ultimate consent form - GDPR edition
======================================

Usage and storage of your data
______________________________
Your personal data will be collected, used and stored for this study.  This includes data from your brain and other scans, and may also include test results from the study you took part in, family and medical history and also data such as gender and age. The collection, use and storage of your data are done for the purpose of conducting this study as well as further scientific research in the [field of neuroscience], as detailed below.

Confidentiality of your data
____________________________
To protect your privacy, your data will be given a code. Your name and other information that can directly identify you, will be omitted. [Identifiable facial features on the brain scans will also be removed]. Data can only be traced back to you with an the encryption key. The encryption key remains safely stored in the local research institute. The data that is sent to the participating research centers will only contain the code, not your name or other data with which you can be identified. The data cannot be traced back to you in reports and publications about the study. However, by using additional data linked to your name (for example brain scans obtained from your medical records) one could potentially associate your imaging or other information in our database back to you. In addition, a security breach (break in or cyber attack) might lead to someone being able to link you to your data. This risk is very low because your data are stored in a secure database, and the information about your identity is stored separately from the data themselves, linked only through a code.

Access to your data for verification
____________________________________
Some people can access all your data at the research location. Including the data without a code. This is necessary to check whether the study is being conducted in a good and reliable manner and to be able to notify you and your physician in the case of any incidental findings resulting from your brain scans. Persons who have access to your data for review are: the local committee that monitors the safety of the study, the data controller working for the primary investigator of the study, and local, national and international supervisory authorities, for example [...]. They will keep your data confidential. We ask you to consent to this access.

Retention period of your data
_____________________________
Your data must be kept for at least [...] years at the research location. A process exists for re-evaluating the conditions of data retention.

Withdrawing consent
___________________
You can withdraw your consent to the use of your personal data. This applies to this study and also to storage and use for future research. The study data collected until the moment you withdraw your consent can still be used in this study.

Passing on to countries outside the European Union (EU)
_______________________________________________________
In this study, your encoded data can also be accessed by and sent to countries outside the EU and countries with similar data protection laws. This is necessary so that non-EU based scientific collaborators in this research can run analyses to verify the scientific results produced from this study or for future research unrelated to this specific study. In those countries, the EU rules on the protection of your personal data do not apply. However, your privacy will be protected at an equal level, by means of a Data Sharing and Usage Agreement.

More information about your rights when processing data
